            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
              These soft-boiled, marinated eggs are perfect to add to your ramen
              soup. I was given this recipe by the owner of a great little ramen
              shop I stopped at for lunch one day. The eggs turn out beautifully
              every time.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>4 large eggs</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon cooking sake</li>
              <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Bring eggs to room temperature by soaking them in warm water for
                about 10 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a low boil.</li>
              <li>
                Carefully pierce the bottom of each egg with thumb tack. Gently
                lower eggs into the boiling water.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gently lower eggs into water and boil for 6 minutes 20 seconds.
                Remove eggs and place in a bowl of ice water until completely
                cool, about 2 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                While the eggs are cooling, stir together soy sauce, mirin,
                sake, and pepper for marinade in a bowl.
              </li>
              <li>
                Carefully peel cooled eggs; try to start from the middle of the
                shell and work you way up and down.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place whole peeled eggs in marinade. Refrigerate for at least 2
                to 4 hours, or up to 2 days for stronger flavor, turning eggs
                every 30 minutes or as often as you prefer.
              </li>
              <li>Slice eggs in half when ready to use</li>
            </ol>
